                                <p>
                                    Described in as few words as possible, the task set in front of us was the following: "We want to build a SAAS that will help small business plan and allocate their budget spendings, have operational financial reporting available at all times and have that integrated with their banks. And we need it to look wonderful and be super easy to use.". Our job was to plan the application workflow, engineer the UX, design the layout and deliver the layout coded, ready for test driven development implementation.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-4">
                            <div class="boxed bg--white">
                                <span class="h2">2.</span>
                                <h5>Our Solution:</h5>
                                <p>
                                    We began by discovering who the actual users of this product are going to be, what are their needs and went on to define the core solutions the app needs to provide and core features it should have. After that we went on and defined user stories and wireframes for the whole app. Once we had that nailed down our UI team was able to move in and create a realy pleasant interface that effectivly communicates all the important information and data to the customer.


                                     
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-4">
                            <div class="boxed bg--white">
                                <span class="h2">3.</span>
                                <h5>Result:</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Once all the layouts were ready our front end developers took over and converted the layout into a clickable interface ready to be tested and implemented. The overall result of our efforts was an application interface that was spot-on, ready to serve it's intended customers and built to maximise develeopment resource's efficiency and deliver the final product as fast and as stable as possible.

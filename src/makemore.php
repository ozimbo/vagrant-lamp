                                <p>
                                    Described in as few words as possible, the task set in front of us was the following: "We want to build a SAAS that will help small business plan and allocate their budget spendings, have operational financial reporting available at all times and have that integrated with their banks. And we need it to look wonderful and be super easy to use.". Our job was to plan the application workflow, engineer the UX, design the layout and deliver the layout coded, ready for test driven development implementation.

                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-4">
                            <div class="boxed bg--white">
                                <span class="h2">2.</span>
                                <h5>Our Solution:</h5>
                                <p>
                                    The core idea was to move heavy calculation processes out of the limited computing capacity of the device into unlimitied resources environment (the cloud) and allow data to flow both ways. Simply said - make it possible for cloud/mobile app developers to have control over devices and have their data streams available directly from within the code - in terms of objects and methods.


                                     
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-4">
                            <div class="boxed bg--white">
                                <span class="h2">3.</span>
                                <h5>Result:</h5>
                                <p>
                                     In order to do this we decided to develop a set of libraries to handle data transfer from the device to the Accelmo platform (C++, MQTT); to develop a cloud based platform to handle device registration, credentials and monitoring (Python, NodeJS); to develop a set of services within the platform for distribution and exchange of data between registered devices and remote application end points (NodeJS/RabbitMQ).
                                </p>
